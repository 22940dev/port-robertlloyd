## Day 3: Copenhagen

Having stayed up late completing [the first post in this series][1], my first full day in Copenhagen gets off to a late start.

There’s a lot to see, but having visited once before — albeit briefly when I spoke at an event in 2012 — a few places have already been crossed off my list. And yet, little feels familiar. I certainly don’t remember the area around [Tivoli Gardens][2] being as commercial as it is now. That my hotel sits in the middle of a construction site suggests my memory is fine, it’s just that Copenhagen is flourishing and continuing to grow.

My stomach rumbling, I look for recommendations on Foursquare. Some former colleagues worked with a client here several years ago so many restaurants have familiar faces sat beside them. The top suggestion is [*Paludan Bogcafé*{lang="da"}][3] located just off *Strøget*{lang="da"} — one of the longest shopping streets in Europe apparently. This cafe come library is surprisingly roomy, despite its popularity. Food is ordered at the counter, which is hidden behind a lengthy queue; that no one wants to abandon it suggests the food worth the wait. I order the chicken burger, which comes with lightly roasted potatoes and a pot of chilli mayo. Savouring this first bite, every mile of the 600 travelled so far is *totally* worth it.

One of the few attractions I’ve lined up on this trip is [*Designmuseum Danmark*{lang="da"}][4]. Heading in that direction I spot the [*Rundetårn*{lang="da"}][5] (Round Tower). Climbing to the top of tall buildings is a routine activity on my travels, one that typically requires clambering up a thousand or so narrow steps to a view that gives me sweaty hands. This tower – whose entry price is a very reasonable 25 DKK – features a gentle cylindrical slope with only a few steps at the top. It delivers a view over the local neighbourhood but anything much further away is obscured by clouds.

Leaving the tower I continue east on a route that takes in the familiar postcard image of *Nyhavn*{lang="da"}, crosses the courtyard of [Amalienborg Palace][6] which frames the view of [Frederik’s Church][7]. A few more steps and I reach the museum, housed in what appears to be a small but grand townhouse.

Inside is a full array of commercially designed products, including an impressively curated gallery of Danish chairs. Yet given Denmark’s design heritage, the permanent collection feels a little underwhelming. Their current exhibition, [Night Fever][8], is far more extensive. A retrospective covering the design history of nightclubs from the 1960s to today, it includes everything from album covers, lighting rigs, architectural concepts, even a brick from the Haçienda. The curation feels like a labour of love.

## Day 4: Copenhagen and Malmo. And Trelleborg.

I open my curtains and look through rain-splattered windows to see dark skies and a very wet building site. The hotel has its restaurant on the top floor, but the view from here is just as depressing. The overpriced breakfast buffet doesn’t help matters. As I look out across a drab cityscape, I wonder why I decided to visit the wettest part of Europe during the wettest time of year. This is going to be a day spent largely indoors, and most of the museums in Copenhagen are closed on a Monday.

The [Royal Danish Library][9] is open, however, so I head there. Its modern extension was constructed at the turn of the century and has since been dubbed the *Black Diamond*. Much like its contemporary, [the Sage][10] in Gateshead its interior attempts to imply magnificence with a large, well-lit atrium, yet it feels somewhat vacant and soulless. The older part of the building with its reading room and rows of books, directories and encyclopaedias, is far more interesting.

In the cafe, I look online for tips on how to make the best of bad weather when taking photos. Look for contrast. Pick out bright colours. Search for reflections. I set myself an assignment but eventually find myself back on *Strøget*{lang="da"} engaging in retail therapy instead. Expecting the need for warmer clothing before I travel further north, I buy a new jacket and a thick woollen jumper.

Leaving the store, the skies have darkened meaning the bright red Chinese lanterns strung across the street are hard to ignore. With rain gathering in puddles below, I take heed of the earlier advice I had found and start kneeling in the middle of the street, searching for a half-decent composition. I’m fairly happy with [the result][11].

* * *

For dinner, I’ve arranged to meet [my friend Emil][12] in nearby *Malmö*{lang="sv"}, just a short train ride across the Øresund Bridge and the border between Denmark and Sweden. We meet on the platform of [Triangeln][13], a station that sits deep below the city whose illuminated walls animate each time a trains approaches.

“I was thinking we could try this Chinese place”. I laugh… not again!

We head to [*Köket Lu*{lang="sv"}][14] on *Davidshallstorg*{lang="sv"}. I’m trying to eat less meat. I even considered eating exclusively vegetarian meals on this trip. The grilled tofu fits the bill but predictably, I’m drawn to the roast duck.

The last time I was in *Malmö*{lang="sv"} I was questioning whether I wanted to continue working on the web; it’s nice that I can return with a resolution to my career crisis. Emil’s got a new job too, at Bonnier News. This provokes memories of similar work at the Guardian and tackling the varied nuanced issues that emerge when you try to automate the presentation of journalism.

The roast duck is delightful, though not that filling as it’s mostly bone. I regret my earlier decision. Next, we head to the [*Bullen*{lang="sv"}][15], apparently *Malmö*{lang="sv"}’s oldest pub, though it wouldn’t feel out of place in London. Being a weeknight, it’s just the one pint as the conversation moves onto survivor programmes, in particular [<cite>Alone</cite>][16].

An hour later, I appear to be its next contestant. Having not paid enough attention to the train I was boarding, rather than nearing Copenhagen, I find myself on my way to the small town of *Trelleborg*{lang="sv"}, 20 miles south of *Malmö*{lang="sv"}. It’s possible that here, in its small, chilly railway station, that I lost my debit card. This must be the part of the trip that, if animated over a map, would see the route comically go round in circles before doubling back on itself.

## Day 5: Louisiana Museum of Modern Art

Another grey day, but with the museums open again I’m spoilt for choice. Emil recommended I visit either [ARKEN][17] or [Louisiana][18] modern art galleries. I choose the later, intrigued by [<cite>Hot Pink Turquoise</cite>][19], an exhibition featuring the work of Belgian artist Ann Veronica Janssens.

There’s a remarkable symmetry between this and that of Olafur Eliasson’s [recent exhibition at Tate Modern][20]. In <cite>Blue, Red and Yellow</cite>, visitors are encouraged to step into a large perspex container filled with smoke illuminated by those colours. Disorienting and disembodying, only six people are allowed entry at a time. Eliasson created a similar effect in his work <cite>Your blind passenger</cite>; it should be noted that Janssens’ work precedes it by about nine years.

If Janssens’ colourful smoke-filled cube isn’t enough Instagram fodder, then Yayoi Kusama’s permanent installation, <cite>Gleaming Lights Of The Souls</cite> does not disappoint either. This small room is filled with hundreds of lights suspended from the ceiling reflected by mirrors on five sides and a floor flooded with water. A small gangway allows viewers to experience this wonder from its very centre.

I end up spending several hours in this museum. If not absorbed by colourfully illuminated rooms, I’m riding a single-speed bike around one of the gallery spaces, exploring the sculpture garden with views over the nearby beach, or enjoying a coffee in its calming cafe. I’m getting a full-on culture fix in what feels like a meditative retreat.

* * *

I’m catching the sleeper to Stockholm early next morning, which I need to board at *Hässleholm*{lang="sv”} in southern Sweden. This requires an hour and a half connecting journey from Copenhagen. Waiting in the station allows me to admire its design which until this point I have largely ignored. The large roof of the departure hall, with its wooden beams and terracotta floor tiles, makes it feel very homely. If this building were located in England, it would surely be owned by the National Trust.

* * *

In *Hässleholm*{lang="sv"}, the sleeper arrives like something out of a movie (in my mind its though plumes of steam, but that’s impossible as it’s a diesel locomotive). It hauls a series of sturdy looking carriages, some of which appear to pre-date the war. I quickly find my cabin which is already occupied by five others, although I only ever see their sketched outlines. The passenger on the bunk opposite is a snorer, his deep breathing and throat gurgling sounds disturbingly closer than they are, a fact I continually have to confirm. It’s going to be a long night.
