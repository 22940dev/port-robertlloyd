I’ve been building interfaces to the web since 2004. At renowned user experience agency **Clearleft** I designed websites for a variety of organisations and instigated a comprehensive redesign of the professional web font service, **Fontdeck**. At **The Guardian**, I was part of the team that launched their responsive website and next-generation mobile applications.

Today I work with businesses to help them make a meaningful impact within their industry. I bring a critical eye to the design process, and advocate renewal over wholesale reinvention. But honestly, I’m still trying to figure all this stuff out. Maybe you are too? If so, [let’s talk](/contact/).
