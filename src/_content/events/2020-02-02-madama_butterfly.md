summary: 'A young Japanese girl meets an American naval officer, she with a dream of American freedom and he with a longing for the exotic East. But is it really love or the perfect example of the attraction of opposites? Madama Butterfly is a story about culture clash and crushed dreams set to Pucciniâ€™s exquisite music.'
