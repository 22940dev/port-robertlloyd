That was the answer I gave [Kate](https://twitter.com/qwertykate) when she asked me why I thought Brexit might not happen. This was Harold Macmillan’s response when asked what he thought would most likely knock a government off course – although [some dispute](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3577416/As-Macmillan-never-said-thats-enough-quotations.html) whether he ever actually said this.

At the time, I had wrongly attributed this to James Callaghan, having confused it with <q>A lie can be halfway round the world before the truth has got its boots on</q>, which he said in an [address to the Commons](http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1976/nov/01/conduct-of-members-1#S5CV0918P0_19761101_HOC_208). But variations of this phrase have [been around since the 18th century](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/07/13/truth/).

Where’s a [Winston Churchill quote](https://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/quotes/quotes-falsely-attributed/) when you need one.
