I’ve been building interfaces to the web since 2004. At renowned user experience agency **Clearleft** I designed websites for a variety of businesses and instigated a comprehensive redesign of the professional web font service, **Fontdeck**. At **The Guardian**, I was part of the team that launched their responsive website and next-generation mobile applications.
